#   Using GestureDetector to make the navigation in the app
We need to able navigation in our application, for example, to go to Home Page to the Challenge Page.
In the widget that will get the gesture, we put a parameter that is the function generated by the Gesture Detector:
```
    class QuizWidget extends StatefulWidget {
        final VoidCallback onTap;
        
        const QuizCardWidget(
                {Key? key, required this.title, 
                required this.completed, 
                required this.percent, 
                required this.onTap}) : super(key: key);
```

And in our container that contains the widget, we put the GestureDetector:
```
    child: GestureDetector(
        onTap: (){
        yourFunctionHere();
        },
        child: Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
```

#   Using Navigator
Navigator is a already existent class in Flutter that works like a stack of pages. When you load a new one, you will put him in the top of the stack:
```
    onTap: () {
        Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => ChallengePage()));
    },
```

Remember that MaterialPageRoute is used in Android, and for iOS is the Cupertino

#   Creating easy backButtons
Flutter already have some buttons, like close bluttons, back button. We will use the back button:
```
    children: [
        BackButton(),
```
He already have the function Navigator.pop() which will pop the last index in the stack and return one index automatically. Manually, we can do this:
```
    children: [
        IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.close), onPressed: () {
            Navigator.pop(context);
    }),
```

#   Ignoring the Pointer Selection with IgnorePointer
In our application, if the user selects an answer, he can't change his option, so we need to ignore the anothers selections he will make in answers:
```
    child: IgnorePointer(
        ignoring: disabled,     //disable is a var we created, setted when the user answer the questions
```
