# Creating a folder and the archive to splash page
-   To make an organized repository, I separated all pages (and your components) in different folders. Then I made a folder to splash page
```
    /devquiz/lib/splash/splash_page.dart
```

# Creating a Stateless Widget in VS Code
-   The Splash page doesn't need any state, is just a transition page, so we use a Stateless Widget.
To make things easier, when you install Flutter in VS Code, the IDE helps you with some commands. One of them is when you type "**stl**" and press Enter. Will be created automatically a class with your Stateless Widget.
